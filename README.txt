You can have your own data and plan file, as long as you put it in the order of execution, you should be fine. This is just how I produced my output.
When you have your own file, remember to put the number of path(s) or plan(s) on top of it, you can look it my data.txt file and plan.txt file for more informations.
I added two more line in the data.txt file to generate max 3 outputs according to what he said in the class. You can take it off and it will match with the project pdf decribed.
